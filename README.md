# Website cost calculator for web design agencies

React-based single page web application. A useful tool that provides two-way client-to-agency interaction. The application has a client side, allowing customers to calculate the cost of creating a website. The committed order is recorded in real-database, which can be accessed by administrators in the administrator side of the app.

The application is fully responsive and scalable. A ready-to-use component library allows adding new elements to the calculator directly on-the-fly.
