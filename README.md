# Webprice app for digital agencies
React-based single page web application. A useful tool that provides two-way client-to-agency interaction. The application has a client side, allowing customers to evaluate the cost of creating a website. The committed order is recorded in realtime-database, which can be accessed in the administrator side of the app. The application is fully responsive and scalable. A ready-to-use component library allows adding new elements to the quiz directly on-the-fly.
